# rgm-snake-ai

A simple version of the "snake" game, unoptimized and not very modular, but usefull for testing out various AI gameplay techniques.

As time goes on, I'll be experimenting with various AI methods to have the computer play the game, probably starting of with some form of neural net with training sessions.

To run the basic version of the game, serve up the files using a simple web server, and point your browser to 'snake.html' (eg http://localhost:[your web server's port]//snake.html)

The controls are simple, the standard WSAD key layout, W for 'up', S for 'down', A for 'left', and D for 'right'.
